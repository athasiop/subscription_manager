HOW TO EXECUTE USER APP-2 WAYS:
1) OPEN THE EXECUTABLE (NAME) FILE, CONNECT TO THE APP VIA LOGIN OR SIGN-UP WITH A NEW ACC
(THIS MAY NOT WORK IF THE GOOGLE CLOUD IS NOT CONNECTED)

2)i)RUN THE SQL DUMP AND THE USERS DUMP (THE .SQL SCRIPTS)
  ii)OPEN THE EXECUTABLE (NAME) FILE, CONNECT TO THE APP VIA LOGIN OR SIGN-UP WITH A NEW ACC
  (IF CONNECTION WITH CLOUD DOESN'T WORK FOR ANY REASON, YOU CAN RUN IT LOCALLY)

WE ALSO MADE THE COMPANY APP AND YOU CAN RUN IT AS AN EXECUTABLE FILE WITH THE SAME WAY AS
THE USER APP.
